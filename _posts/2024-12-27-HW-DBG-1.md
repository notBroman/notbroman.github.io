# First power on

Nothing exploded when I first plugged the USB-C cable into the PCB, but it's not charging the battery either...
So not great, but could have gone way worse.

# Power delivery

Looking at the PCB when the power supply is connected, we see that 1 LED is on.
It's orange and connected to the power-good pin !PG of the charging IC, which is active low.
Therefore, the power output of the charging IC works... yay.
Looking at the other LED connected to the charging IC, it should be red, we see... well nothing, it's off.
This LED is connected to the charging pin !CHG, which is also active low.
Well, maybe I should attach a battery; still nothing.
This is going to be an issue, the power output is good, but the battery is not charging for some reason.
That means it's time to look at some datasheets, schematics and routing diagrams.

For reference, here is the schematic for the power delivery module, for the charging the ICs U5, the LiPo charging IC ([BQ24090DGQ](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/bq24090.pdf)) and U1, the battery protection IC ([BQ29728DSER](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/bq2970.pdf)) could be where the issue stems from.

When opening the datasheet for the charging IC and looking at the bottom of the first page, we see a sample design for a typical application.
And looks like I done goofed, the GNDs should be connected (labels **GNDA** and **PACK-** in the schematic).
That's not too bad, but let's look a bit further and see if there are any other issues.
We also see that the **ISET2** pins are connected differently in the typical application and mine.
To verify this lets see the pinout description of the device.

![charging_pinout](media/charging_pinout.png)
![battery_spec](media/battery_spec.png)

The pinout description in table 7-1 shows that the **ISET2** pin sets the max input/output current of the usb-c port, which I have chosen as 500 mA.
This is fine according to the chosen batteries' specification as shown above.

After debugging for a week I figured out my oversight, these are 5 V LEDs attached to a battery that provides 3.7 - 4.2 V with a series resistor; classic mistake.

## Is it the battery protection?

Me hooking up the battery protection incorrectly is definitely possible.
However, when I measure the voltages before and after the IC, I see the same valid voltage leading me to believe the IC works.

# Next steps

The time for a redesign has come.
I'm giving up on this PCB, taking what works and simplifying the rest.
Simplicity is the goal.
Simplicity should have been the governing princpile from the very beginning.
