# Revision time

Turns out that the motors can be driven with a voltage range of 3 - 9 V, this simplifies a lot of things.
It was never needed to use a boost converter, all this pain was for nothing.

The following features are to be included in the redesign of the hardware:

- on-board MCU
- programming via an on-board USB-C port
- firmware debugging using JTAG
- on-board motor driver
- odometry using an IMU (gyroscope & accelerometer) and an encoder on each wheel
- wall detection using IR LEDs and IR photo-transistors


# Redesigning power delivery

I will switch to using a linear regulator for the motors and the microprocessor, namely the [ADP1706](https://www.alldatasheet.com/datasheet-pdf/pdf/533843/AD/ADP1706.html) series.
It provides the functionalities I need a 0.75 - 5.5 V Input and 3.3 V Output at a maximum 1 A.
Additionally, a switch to turn different parts on and off separately is added.
The sections that can be turned on and off are:

- the MCU
- the motors
- the systems power

Furthermore, the boot option is given it's own switch for toggling.

# The MCU

The ESP32-S3-MINI-1 module is chosen due to the form factor and the functionality it provides.
The most important of which are:
- ADCs for the inputs of the photo-transistors
- PWM for the motor control
- I2C for the IMU
- JTAG interface
- Interrupt pins

# Motor driver

The [DRV8833](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/drv8833.pdf) chip is the chosen motor driver IC in a 16 pin TSSOP package.
The driver can be disabled using the active low nSLEEP pin.
For current sensing 200 mΩ resistors are used.
The current sense resistors are pulling down the **AISEN** and **BISEN** pins, one for each H-bridge.

The active low nFAULT pin shows if the IC detects a fault such as too much current drawn by the motors.
Each H-bridge is given two PWM signals and an enable signal.
The datasheet shows how to drive the motors, by providing the necessary inputs.

| xIn1    | xIn2    | xOut1    | xOut2    | function    |
|---------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| 0   | 0   | Z   | Z   | coast/fast decay     |
| 0   | 1   | H   | L   | forward   |
| 1   | 0   | L   | H   | backward  |
| 1   | 1   | H   | H   | break/slow decay     |

When the motors receive a PWM signal instead of a high signal the motor speed is proportional to said PWM signal.
However, it is probably best to not give a PWM signal to the motors when wanting to break.

The following image shows the chip and connections used to drive the two motors.

# USB connection

The USBs 5 V will fry the MCU that operates on 3.3 V.
Therefore, a low dropout regulator facilitates compatibility between the USB-C connection and the ESP32.
To choose the power mode of the USB connection the CC pins pulled down using 5.1 kΩ resistors.
Pulling the pins down using 5.1 kΩ resistors enables the delivery of 5 V at 3 A for a maximum of 15 W of power delivery.
The data is transmitted to the MCU by connecting the data pins of the USB-C connector to pin 23 (D-) and pin 24 (D+) of the MCU.

Power is always enabled when a USB cable is connected.
The assumption is that a program will be flashed to the MCU, when a USB cable is connected.
Therefore, the power cannot be disabled during the process.

# Odometry

The odometry relies on counting the pulses from the motor encoders.
The IMU aids the odometry by providing an absolute measurement.
Both sensors give similar data, direction and speed.
Using a Bayes filter fuses the data from the odometry and IMU can be fused.
By combining the data points the certainty of the data can be increased.

# Obstacle detection

IR LEDs and IR photo-transistors are an easy solution for finding obstacles.
This strategy works over a mid to short range.
However, this simple trick does not give a distance.
The only thing that is obtained the information that there is an obstacle.

Recalling the basics of photonics, the closer the object the higher the intensity on the photo-resistor.
That's the reason why the photo-transistors are connected to analog digital converters on the MCU rather than a digital input.

# The PCB

The PCB is 4 layer design with a 3.3 V and GND reference plane.
The reference planes are the inner two layers, the outer two layers are signal layers.
All components are placed on the top layer.
Most components are SMD/SMT.
The only through hole component is the header for the JTAG interface.

Things I forgot because god forbid I remember everything:
- An LED connected to a pin
- Pull-up resistors for the I2C bus
